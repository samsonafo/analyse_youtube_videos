# YouTube View Predictor

This project is a web application built using Streamlit that predicts the number of views a YouTube video might get based on its title, description, and tags. The prediction model is pre-trained and uses text processing techniques to analyze the input data.

## Features

- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleans and processes the input text by removing special characters, tokenizing, and eliminating stopwords.
- **View Prediction**: Uses a pre-trained machine learning model to predict the potential number of views for a YouTube video.
- **Interactive Interface**: Provides an easy-to-use interface for users to input video details and get predictions instantly.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Joblib
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/youtube-view-predictor.git
cd youtube-view-predictor
\`\`\`

### 2. Install Required Packages

Install the required Python packages using pip:

\`\`\`bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
\`\`\`

The \`requirements.txt\` file should include:

\`\`\`
streamlit
pandas
joblib
scikit-learn
nltk
\`\`\`

### 3. Download NLTK Stopwords

Ensure the NLTK stopwords are downloaded:

\`\`\`python
import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
\`\`\`

### 4. Place the Pre-trained Model

Make sure the pre-trained model file (\`youtube_view_predictor.pkl\`) is placed in the project directory. If you don't have this file, you'll need to train a model or obtain it from the project owner.

### 5. Run the Application

Launch the Streamlit app:

\`\`\`bash
streamlit run app.py
\`\`\`

### 6. Use the App

- Enter the title, description, and tags of your YouTube video.
- Click the "Predict Views" button to see the predicted view count.

## Project Structure

- \`app.py\`: Main application file containing the Streamlit app.
- \`youtube_view_predictor.pkl\`: Pre-trained model used for making predictions.
- \`requirements.txt\`: List of dependencies required to run the application.

## Future Enhancements

- **Model Improvement**: Incorporate more features (e.g., video length, channel statistics) to improve prediction accuracy.
- **Deployment**: Host the app on a cloud platform like Heroku or Streamlit Sharing for public use.
- **UI/UX Enhancements**: Improve the user interface for better user experience.
